# ExaDigiT/RAPS

ExaDigiT's Resource Allocator and Power Simulator (RAPS) schedules workloads and
estimates dynamic system power at specified time intervals. RAPS either schedules
synthetic workloads or replays system telemetry workloads,
provides system monitoring during simulation, and an outputs a report of scheduling
and power statistics at the end of the simulation. RAPS also can interface with
the FMU cooling model by providing CDU-level power inputs to the cooling model,
and reporting the statistics back to the user. RAPS also has built-in plotting
capabilities to generate plots of power and cooling at the end of simulation runs.
An optional RAPS dashboard is also provided, which requires also running the RAPS server.
Instructions for setup and usage are given below. An online documentation of ExaDigiT with a sub part concerning RAPS is also available [here](https://exadigit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Perform Network Simulation

Lassen is one of the few datasets that has networking data. See `raps/dataloaders/lassen.py` for how to
get the datasets. To run a network simulation, use the following command:

    raps run -f /opt/data/lassen/Lassen-Supercomputer-Job-Dataset --system lassen --policy fcfs --backfill firstfit --start '2019-08-22T00:00:00+00:00' -t 12h --arrival poisson --net

To simulate synthetic network tests:

    raps run --system lassen -w network_test --net -t 15m

    raps run --system lassen -w inter_job_congestion --net -t 15m

Run network congestion tests outside of RAPS:

    python scripts/run_inter_job_congestion.py --config config/lassen.yaml -v

## Node Allocation Strategies

RAPS supports different node allocation strategies for studying the impact of job placement on network performance and energy consumption. These strategies are based on the research presented in ["Watch Out for the Bully! Job Interference Study on Dragonfly Network" (Yang et al., SC16)](https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2016.63).

### Available Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `contiguous` | Assigns nodes sequentially (first N available) | Maintains network locality, reduces inter-job interference |
| `random` | Randomly samples nodes from available pool | Distributes traffic for load balancing, may cause "bully" effect |
| `hybrid` | High-communication jobs get random, low-communication get contiguous | Balances benefits of both approaches |

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Contiguous allocation (default behavior)
raps run --system frontier --allocation contiguous

# Random allocation
raps run --system frontier --allocation random

# Hybrid allocation with custom threshold
raps run --system frontier --allocation hybrid --hybrid-threshold 0.5
```

### Hybrid Strategy Details

The hybrid strategy determines allocation based on a job's communication intensity, computed from its network TX/RX traces:
- Jobs with intensity >= threshold: assigned using **random** allocation
- Jobs with intensity < threshold: assigned using **contiguous** allocation

The `--hybrid-threshold` parameter (default: 0.5) controls this cutoff. A lower threshold means more jobs get random allocation.

### Combining with Network Simulation

To study the full impact of allocation strategies on network congestion and energy:

```bash
# Compare contiguous vs random allocation with network simulation
raps run --system lassen --allocation contiguous --net -t 1h -o output_contiguous
raps run --system lassen --allocation random --net -t 1h -o output_random
```

## Snapshot of extracted workload data

To reduce the expense of extracting the needed data from the telemetry parquet files,
RAPS saves a snapshot of the extracted data in NPZ format. The NPZ file can be
given instead of the parquet files for more quickly running subsequent simulations, e.g.:

    raps run -f jobs_2024-02-20_12-20-39.npz

## Cooling models

We provide several example cooling models from the repo https://code.ornl.gov/exadigit/POWER9CSM. To download them run:

    sudo apt install make unzip libgomp1
    make fetch-example-fmus

- Note: May require installation of make and unzip **or** manually download the fmus from the repo.

Once downloaded, to activate cooling when running RAPS,
use `--cooling` or `-c` argument. e.g.,

    raps run --system marconi100 -c

    raps run --system lassen -c

    raps run --system summit -c

## Support for multiple system partitions

Multi-partition systems are supported by running `raps multi-parts ...` command, where a list of partitions can be specified using the `-x` flag as follows:

    raps run-parts -x setonix/part-cpu setonix/part-gpu

or simply:

    raps run-parts -x setonix

This will simulate synthetic workloads on two partitions as defined in `config/setonix-cpu` and `config/setonix-gpu`. To replay telemetry workloads from another system, e.g., Marconi100's PM100 dataset, first create a .npz snapshot of the telemetry data, e.g.,

    raps run-parts --system marconi100 -f /path/to/marconi100/job_table.parquet

This will dump a .npz file with a randomized name, e.g. ac23db.npz. Let's rename this file to pm100.npz for clarity. Note: can control-C when the simulation starts. Now, this pm100.npz file can be used as follows:

    raps run-parts -x setonix -f pm100.npz --arrival poisson --scale 192

## Modifications to telemetry replay

There are three ways to modify replaying of telemetry data:

1. `--arrival`. Changing the arrival time distribution - replay cases will default to `--arrival prescribed`, where the jobs will be submitted exactly as they were submitted on the physical machine. This can be changed to `--arrival poisson` to change when the jobs arrive, which is especially useful in cases where there may be gaps in time, e.g., when the system goes down for several days, or the system is is underutilized.

    raps run -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR,$DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR --arrival poisson

2. `--policy`. Changing the way the jobs are scheduled. The `--policy` flag will be set by default to `replay` in cases where a telemetry file is provided, in which case the jobs will be scheduled according to the start times provided. Changing the `--policy` to `fcfs` or `backfill` will use the internal scheduler, e.g.:

    raps run -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR,$DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR --policy fcfs --backfill firstfit -t 12h

3. `--scale`. Changing the scale of each job in the telemetry data. The `--scale` flag will specify the maximum number of nodes for each job (generally set this to the max number of nodes of the smallest partition), and randomly select the number of nodes for each job from one to max nodes. This flag is useful when replaying telemetry from a larger system onto a smaller system.

4. `--shuffle`. Shuffle the jobs before playing.

## Job-level power output example for replay of single job

    raps run -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR,$DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR --jid 1234567 -o

## Compute stats on telemetry data, e.g., average job arrival time

    raps telemetry -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR,$DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR

## Build and run Docker container

    make docker_build && make docker_run

## Third party schedulers

To install third-party schedulers, such as ScheduleFlow, run:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

### Setup Simulation Server

See instructions in [server/README.md](https://code.ornl.gov/exadigit/simulationserver)

### Setup Dashboard

See instructions in [dashboard/README.md](https://code.ornl.gov/exadigit/simulation-dashboard)

## Running Tests

RAPS uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for its test suite.
Before running tests, ensure that you have a valid data directory available (e.g., `/opt/data`) and set the environment variable `RAPS_DATA_DIR` to point to it.

### Run all tests
```bash
RAPS_DATA_DIR=/opt/data pytest -n auto -x
```

By default, tests are parallelized with `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto`) to speed up execution.
The `-x` flag stops execution after the first failure. Add `-v` to run in verbose mode.

### Run tests on multi-partition systems

```bash
pytest -v -k "multi_part_sim"
```

### Run only network-related tests

```bash
RAPS_DATA_DIR=/opt/data pytest -n auto -x -m network
```

See `pytest.ini` for the different options for `-m`.

### Run a specific test file

```bash
RAPS_DATA_DIR=/opt/data pytest tests/systems/test_engine.py
```
